-- **Known bugs** --
- pawns 2-field move
- if piece\_1 capture piece\_2 (then if you click random piece it will capture piece_1)

<br/>

-- **To do** --
- get rid of multiple map
- add pawn capturing 
- change pawn to other piece 
- king have to be captured to win a game
- get rid of include cpp file
